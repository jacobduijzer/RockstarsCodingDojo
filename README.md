# Rockstars Coding Dojo
C# katas for a Coding Dojo

## Coding Dojo mindset

* We are here to learn
* Slow down, no deadlines
* Doing it right (at least for once)
* Collaboration

## Red-Green-Refactor

* Red — think about what you want to develop
* Green — think about how to make your tests pass
* Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

## The Three Rules of TDD

* Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
* Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
* Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.

## Four Rules of Simple Design [^1]

* Passes the tests
* Reveals intention
* No duplication
* Fewest elements
