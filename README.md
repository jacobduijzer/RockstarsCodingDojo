* Collaboration

## Red-Green-Refactor [^2]

* Red — think about what you want to develop
* Green — think about how to make your tests pass
* Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

## The Three Rules of TDD [^3]

* Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
* Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
* Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.
