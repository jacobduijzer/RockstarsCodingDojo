C# katas for a Coding Dojo

## Coding Dojo mindset

* We are here to learn
* Slow down, no deadlines
* Doing it right (at least for once)
* Collaboration

## Red-Green-Refactor

* Red — think about what you want to develop
* Green — think about how to make your tests pass
* Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation
